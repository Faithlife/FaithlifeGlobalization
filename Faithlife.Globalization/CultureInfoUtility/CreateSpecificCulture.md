# CultureInfoUtility.CreateSpecificCulture method

Creates a CultureInfo that represents the specific culture that is associated with the specified name, or a fallback culture if that specific culture is not available.

```csharp
public static CultureInfo CreateSpecificCulture(LanguageName language)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| language | The language for which the CultureInfo should be created. |

## Return Value

A CultureInfo that represents: The invariant culture, if *language* is the neutral language; or The best-matching specific culture associated with *language*, if *language* is a neutral culture; or The best-matching culture specified by *language*, if *language* is already a specific culture.

## Remarks

This method should be preferred over CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture because it avoids throwing an ArgumentException for cultures that aren't implemented by the .NET Framework; instead, it falls back to the best-matching culture.
